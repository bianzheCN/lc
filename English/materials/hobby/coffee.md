## How long can coffee sit out

Brewed coffee can only last for 30 minutes at room temperature without its flavor being notably compromised.

After a couple of more hours, apart from losing its aromatic compounds, the coffee would develop off-flavors and an unpleasant bitter taste.

Nevertheless, plain black coffee can sit out at room temperature for more than 24 hours after brewing. It will still be considered safe to consume, though its original flavor will be lost. on the other hand, hot coffee with added milk or creamer shouldn't be left out for more than 1 to 2 hours. This applies to almond milk coffee too.
