# Why Do We Need package-lock.json

## Purpose

When you define a dependency in package.json, you always have a ~ or ^ prefix, resulting in the uncertainty of dependency version, this file is to fix this.

### How

In every repo, there will be a package-lock.json file in the root dir, and will set the version of each package you have installed **in stone**.

This file will also be pushed to GitHub, so other people will download it too, making sure the version of dependencies is stable.

### Detail

If you have installed a dependency, it's pretty common that that package requires other dependencies.

They are added in alphabetical order under the file, and each one has a `version` field, `resolved` field that points to the package location, an integrity field used to validate the package's integrity.
