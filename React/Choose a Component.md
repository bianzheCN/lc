# Choose a Component

## Design

- Style of the component: checking out design, seeing that if we can see that the library is adaptable to our design
- Robust and flexible types of components, checking the showcase

## Performance

- Complex user interactions for charts to benchmark the performance of the components, checking the memory usage, CPU usage

## Community

- See if the community is still growing, checking if there is lots of other library building with a dependency on it or there is a lot of discussions focused on it
